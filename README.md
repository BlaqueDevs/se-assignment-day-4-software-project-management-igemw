## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Waterfall follows a linear and sequential approach, where the project is divided into clearly defined phases such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment. Each phase must be completed before the next begins, and going back to modify a previous phase is difficult and costly. In contrast, Agile is iterative and flexible, allowing development to occur in small increments or sprints. Agile teams revisit and revise requirements frequently, promoting continuous improvement and adaptability throughout the project.
Agile Advantages:
1.	Flexibility to Changes: Ideal for dynamic projects with evolving requirements.
2.	Early & Continuous Delivery: Allows users to see progress and provide feedback.
3.	Customer Satisfaction: Frequent involvement keeps the client engaged.
4.	Risk Management: Issues can be identified and fixed early.
5.	Better Quality: Continuous testing ensures fewer defects.
❌ Agile Disadvantages:
1.	Scope Creep Risk: Frequent changes can lead to an ever-expanding scope.
2.	Requires Experienced Team: Self-managing teams need discipline and skill.
3.	Less Predictable Costs: Because of evolving requirements, estimating final cost is tricky.
4.	Not Ideal for Fixed-Contract Projects: Hard to define deliverables upfront.
Waterfall Advantages:
1.	Simple and Structured: Clear steps, good for beginner teams or fixed-scope projects.
2.	Easy to Manage: Progress is measurable through completed phases.
3.	Well-Documented: Useful for future maintenance and audits.
4.	Predictable Budget and Timeline: Ideal for fixed-price contracts.
Waterfall Disadvantages:
1.	Inflexibility: Changes are difficult and expensive to implement once development begins.
2.	Late Testing: Bugs discovered late can delay the project.
3.	Customer Feedback Comes Late: Final product might not match client expectations.
4.	Risk of Obsolescence: Requirements defined early may be outdated by the time the product is delivered.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Waterfall is best for projects with clearly defined requirements, predictable outcomes, and minimal expected changes. It's a good fit when clients need detailed documentation or where regulatory compliance is essential.
Examples:
i.	Government or Defense Projects: Heavily regulated with fixed specifications and strict approval processes.
ii.	Construction Software or Engineering Systems: Changes after development are costly, and detailed planning is required.
iii.	Banking and Financial System Integrations: High reliability and compliance with regulations require detailed up-front planning.
iv.	Medical Device Software: Must meet strict health and safety standards with formal validation and documentation.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
1. Requirement Analysis and Test Planning - Create a test plan that outlines the testing strategy, types of testing (e.g., functional, performance, security), and test cases.
2. Automated Testing - Automating repetitive tests (e.g., unit tests, integration tests, and regression tests) helps ensure consistent results and faster feedback loops.
3. Continuous Integration (CI) / Continuous Deployment (CD) - Implementing CI/CD pipelines enables frequent integration of code changes and automated testing every time new code is added.
With each code commit, automated tests run to verify the new functionality, improving the chances of early bug detection. Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, and CircleCI support CI/CD processes.
4. Code Reviews and Pair Programming - Regular peer code reviews help identify mistakes, ensure adherence to coding standards, and improve the code's maintainability.
Pair programming involves two developers working together on the same task, helping spot issues immediately and enhancing code quality.
5. Test-Driven Development (TDD) - In TDD, developers write unit tests before writing the actual code. This ensures that the software is designed with testability in mind from the start.
6. Automated Code Quality Tools - Tools like SonarQube or Codacy analyze code for potential bugs, vulnerabilities, and code quality issues (e.g., code duplication, complexity). They ensure that the code is not just functional but also clean, maintainable, and secure.
7. Manual Testing - While automation is effective, manual testing is still important, especially for usability, user acceptance testing (UAT), and exploratory testing.
8. Regression Testing - After new features are added or bugs are fixed, regression tests are run to ensure that the changes haven’t introduced new issues in existing functionalities.
9. Performance Testing - Load testing and stress testing ensure that the software can handle expected (and unexpected) user loads.
Tools like JMeter or LoadRunner are often used to simulate heavy traffic and assess system stability and performance.
10. Security Testing - Conduct penetration testing and vulnerability assessments to identify and fix security flaws before release.
Security tools (like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) can help automate security testing.
11. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) - UAT ensures that the software meets end-users' needs and expectations. It typically occurs near the end of development, before release.
